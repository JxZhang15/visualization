# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Final Project


- For each visualization, describe and justify: 

    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    
    Answer: I used Microsoft Excel to create this pie chart, utilizing its built-in charting engine to calculate the proportional distribution of the data.

    > Who is your intended audience? 
   
    Answer: The intended audience includes City of Toronto administrators and departmental managers who are responsible for resource allocation and staffing across the city’s various municipal service locations.

    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
   
    Answer: The visualization conveys the dominance of the Toronto (Downtown) location in handling marriage license requests. It shows that more than half of the city's marriage license volume is concentrated in a single civic centre, while the remaining volume is split among the other three districts.

    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
    
    Answer: I chose a pie chart to highlight "part-to-whole" relationships. I applied clear data labels that show both the category name and the percentage to provide immediate context. I also used distinct colors for each slice to ensure that the boundaries between the different civic centres were visually clear.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 

    Answer: This Excel visualization is not fully reproducible because it relies on manual user-interface interactions (pointing and clicking) rather than code. This impacts the visualization because if the dataset is updated, the chart must be manually recreated or adjusted, which increases the risk of human error compared to a scripted approach.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    
    Answer: I ensured accessibility by including text labels and percentage values directly on the chart slices. This prevents the "legend-scanning" problem, where a user has to look back and forth between a color key and the chart, making it easier for people with color vision deficiencies or cognitive processing challenges to understand the data.

    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    
    Answer: Municipal employees at the Toronto (Downtown) centre are most impacted, as the chart justifies their higher workload. Additionally, residents in Etobicoke or Scarborough might see this and realize their local centres are less crowded, potentially influencing where they choose to apply for their own licenses.

    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    
    Answer: I included the CIVIC_CENTRE and the total sum of MARRIAGE_LICENSES. I excluded the time-series data (TIME_PERIOD) because the goal of this specific visualization was to show geographic distribution rather than changes over time.

    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?

    Answer: The 'underwater labour' involved cleaning the dataset to remove any incomplete records, manually aggregating 14 years of monthly data into four distinct category totals, and translating the technical abbreviations (ET, NY, SC, TO) into user-friendly names for the chart labels.
